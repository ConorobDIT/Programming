This is the assignment for the Texts or Emails question.  The code reads a text file full of messages and checks whether
they are texts or emails.
The Algorithm is the main code.
The Control runs the GUI
The GUI displays a button to start the code and a text area to display the results.
The FileManager class allows reading of the file.
The TextOutput file (from www.codejava.com) allows the results to be displayed in the text area rather than the console.
